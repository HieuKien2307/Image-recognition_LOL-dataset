# Summmary

In this exercise, I will write a program in Python to predict the hero names on the left side of the message bar


# Getting started

In this project, I crawl the training dataset from https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/. As the dataset is quite big, I'm not able to upload it direct through github.
